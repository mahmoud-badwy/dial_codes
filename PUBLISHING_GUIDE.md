# Publishing Guide for dial_codes Package

This guide walks you through the steps to publish your `dial_codes` package to pub.dev.

## Prerequisites

1. **Pub.dev Account**
   - Create an account at [pub.dev](https://pub.dev)
   - You'll need a Google account to sign in

2. **Verify Package Quality**
   - All tests pass âœ…
   - No analyzer issues âœ…
   - Documentation is complete âœ…
   - Example is working âœ…

## Step 1: Verify Package Structure

Run these commands to ensure everything is ready:

```bash
# Check for any issues
flutter analyze

# Run all tests
flutter test

# Check package score (dry run)
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

## Step 2: Update Package Information

Make sure your `pubspec.yaml` has all required fields:

```yaml
name: dial_codes
description: "A comprehensive Flutter package for accessing country dial codes, country information, flags, and more."
version: 0.0.1
homepage: https://github.com/mahmoud-badwy/dial_codes
repository: https://github.com/mahmoud-badwy/dial_codes
issue_tracker: https://github.com/mahmoud-badwy/dial_codes/issues

environment:
  sdk: ^3.8.1
  flutter: ">=1.17.0"
```

**Important Fields:**
- `name` - Package name (must be unique on pub.dev)
- `description` - Short description (60-180 characters recommended)
- `version` - Current version (follow semantic versioning)
- `homepage` - Package homepage URL
- `repository` - Source code repository URL
- `issue_tracker` - Where users can report issues

## Step 3: Verify LICENSE

Ensure you have a LICENSE file. Your package currently has one. Common licenses:
- MIT (most common for Flutter packages)
- BSD
- Apache 2.0

## Step 4: Review Documentation

Ensure these files are complete:
- âœ… `README.md` - Package overview and usage
- âœ… `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- âœ… `LICENSE` - License information
- âœ… `example/` - Working example app

## Step 5: Run Dry Run

Test the publishing process without actually publishing:

```bash
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

This will:
- Validate your package
- Check for common issues
- Show what will be published
- Calculate package score

**Fix any issues** that appear before proceeding.

## Step 6: Publish to Pub.dev

When everything looks good:

```bash
flutter pub publish
```

**What happens:**
1. You'll be prompted to confirm
2. A browser will open for authentication
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. Authorize the pub.dev CLI
5. Package will be uploaded
6. Package will be processed and published

**Note:** Publishing is **permanent** for each version. You cannot unpublish or delete versions (except within the first 7 days).

## Step 7: Verify Publication

After publishing:
1. Visit `https://pub.dev/packages/dial_codes`
2. Check the package page
3. Review the score (aim for 130+)
4. Check documentation rendering
5. Test the example

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Package name already exists"
**Solution:** Choose a different package name in `pubspec.yaml`

### Issue: "Description too short"
**Solution:** Make description at least 60 characters

### Issue: "Missing homepage"
**Solution:** Add `homepage` field to `pubspec.yaml`

### Issue: "Low pub points"
**Solution:** 
- Add documentation comments to public APIs
- Follow Dart style guide
- Add more examples
- Improve README

### Issue: "Example doesn't work"
**Solution:** Test the example app thoroughly before publishing

## Updating Your Package

When you need to publish updates:

1. **Update Version** in `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   version: 0.0.2  # Increment version
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## 0.0.2
   * Bug fixes
   * New features
   ```

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   flutter analyze
   ```

4. **Publish update**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub publish
   ```

## Semantic Versioning

Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **PATCH** (0.0.X) - Bug fixes, no breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.X.0) - New features, no breaking changes
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0) - Breaking changes

Examples:
- `0.0.1` â†’ `0.0.2` - Bug fix
- `0.0.2` â†’ `0.1.0` - New widget added
- `0.1.0` â†’ `1.0.0` - API breaking change
